  [ Sebastian Schulze ]

    be reversed
  * reformatting sourcecode with rustfmt
    and adding rustfmt.toml

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Only call completion when TAB is pressed

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * remove unused dependencies

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Completions can be configured via .toml file
    located in ~/.config/rrun/config.toml

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]

  * read config file in get_config_file()
  * move creation of completers to function
  * panic when $HOME is not found

  [ buster ]
  * created contributors section
  * Update README.rst

  [ Martin Mauch ]
  * Runners can be configured via .toml file
    located in ~/.config/rrun/config.toml
  * Issuing a command without hitting TAB performs completion
  * Completion can specify a trigger that determines its applicability
  * Move running of completions into a closure and run by id
  * External completers can specify an id after a TAB
  * More debug info
  * Fix running of completions to use currently selected completion
  * Move completion and running logic into new Engine trait
  * Add completion and runner for numeric expressions to config
  * fixup! Completions can be configured via .toml file
  * Add completion for Google search and Chrome runner
  * Sort and uniq bash completions

  [ Sebastian Schulze ]
  * removed "echo" completion
    if this is configured, completion only works on the second TAB as expected
  * I actually have chromium, and not google-chrome
    plus i am using dwb (which is x-www-browser) and others might use
    firefox..
    I think on linux "x-www-browser" is the standard way to do this
  * replaced ruby with python for general purpose scripts
    i think all major distributions come with python in the base
    installation, but not ruby. Users might not have ruby,
    so it looks like using python (or even perl, ugh..) would be better
  * add error message
  * output completion in debug
  * update Cargo.lock
  * debug output if cmd runs in background
  * run commands in background unless CTRL is pressed
  * fix url completion for google search
